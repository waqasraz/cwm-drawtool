# CWM Draw Tool #

An alternate interface to the popular open source drawing tool, [SVG-edit](http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/), designed for use in CAST's educational web applications.  SVG-edit is the core editing canvas; this project includes Javascript extensions, HTML, and CSS for the customized interface.

This project also includes an Apache Wicket component for inserting the drawing tool into Wicket applications as well as plugins for including drawing "starters" and upload functionality.

Special thanks to the SVG Edit team for their support and flexibility during the development process.
